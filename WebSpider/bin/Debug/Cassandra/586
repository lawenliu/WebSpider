Description 

This command saves the specified number of key and row caches to the saved caches directory, which you specify in the cassandra.yaml. The key-cache-keys-to-save argument corresponds to the key_cache_keys_to_save in the cassandra.yaml, which is disabled by default, meaning all keys will be saved. The row-cache-keys-to-save argument corresponds to the row_cache_keys_to_save in the cassandra.yaml, which is disabled by default.
