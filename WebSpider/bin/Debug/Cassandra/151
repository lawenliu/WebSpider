Object permissions
Granting or revoking permissions to access Cassandra data.

You use familiar relational database GRANT/REVOKE paradigm to grant or revoke permissions to access Cassandra data. A superuser grants initial permissions, and subsequently a user may or may not be given the permission to grant/revoke permissions. Object permission management is based on internal authorization.

Read access to these system tables is implicitly given to every authenticated user because the tables are used by most Cassandra tools:

system.schema_keyspace
system.schema_columns
system.schema_columnfamilies
system.local
system.peers
