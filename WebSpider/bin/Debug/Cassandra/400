-- Separates an option from an argument that could be mistaken for a option.
keyspace is the name of a keyspace.
table is the name of a table.

The pipe (|) symbol means OR or AND/OR
Ellipsis (...) means repeatable
Orange ( and ) means not literal, indicates scope 


Description 

The nodetool cfhistograms command provides statistics about a table, including number of SSTables, read/write latency, partition (row) size, and cell count. 


Example 

If you are using DataStax Enterprise, performthe Wikipedia demo, and then run this command to get statistics about the solr table in the wiki keyspace. $ nodetool cfhistograms wiki solr
The output shows latencies in microseconds (µs), partition (formerly called row) size in bytes, and the number of SSTables and the cell count. The Offset column corresponds to the x-axis in a histogram. It represents buckets of values, which are a series of ranges. Each offset includes the range of values greater than the previous offset and less than or equal to the current offset. The offsets start at 1 and each subsequent offset is calculated by multiplying the previous offset by 1.2, rounding up, and removing duplicates. The offsets can range from 1 to approximately 25 million, with less precision as the offsets get larger.
For example:
Offset 1 shows that 3579 requests only had to look at one SSTable. The SSTables column corresponds to how many SSTables were involved in a read request.
Offset 86 shows that there were 663 requests with a write latency between 73 and 86 µs. The range falls into the 73 to 86 bucket.

On some versions of Cassandra, the output looks like this:

On other versions of Cassandra 2.0.x, the output does not label the columns. The offset is on the left, the latency on the right:
