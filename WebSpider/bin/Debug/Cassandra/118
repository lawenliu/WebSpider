Installing and deploying a Cassandra cluster using GoGrid
A step-by-step guide for installing the DataStax Community AMI (Amazon Machine Image).


You can use GoGridâ€™s 1-Button Deploy for installing and deploying a developer (3-node) or production (5-node) Cassandra cluster. Additional introductory documentation is available from GoGrid at:
GoGrid Cassandra Wiki
Getting Started 

The 1-Button Deploy of Cassandra does the following: 
Installs the latest version of Cassandra on X-Large SSD Cloud Servers running Debian 7.2.
Installs OpsCenter.
Installs Oracle JDK 7.
Installs Python Driver.
Enables the Firewall Service - All services are blocked except SSH (22) and ping for public traffic.
Deploys Cassandra using virtual nodes (vnodes).


Procedure
Register with GoGrid. 
Fill out the registration form and complete the account verification. 
Access the management console with the login credentials you received in your email.  

Your cluster automatically starts deploying. A green status indicator shows that a server is up and running.

Hover over any item to view its details or right-click to display a context menu.





Login to one of the servers and validate that the servers are configured and communicating: 

Note: You can login to any member of the cluster either with SSH, a third-party client (like PuTTY), or through the GoGrid Console service.
To find your server credentials, right-click the server and select Passwords. 
From your secure connection client, login to the server with the proper credentials. For example from SSH: 
$ ssh root@ip_address

Validate that the cluster is running: 
$ nodestool status


Each node should be listed and it's status and state should be UN (Up Normal):
