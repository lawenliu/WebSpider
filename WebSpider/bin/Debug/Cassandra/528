snapshot
Take a snapshot of one or more keyspaces, or of a table, to backup data.


Take a snapshot of one or more keyspaces, or of a table, to backup data.


Synopsis 
nodetool <options> snapshot ( 
  ( -cf <table> | --column-family <table> ) 
  ( -t <tag> | --tag <tag> )
  -- ( <keyspace> ) | ( <keyspace> ... )
)
 options are: ( -h | --host ) <host name> | <ip address> 
( -p | --port ) <port number> 
( -pw | --password ) <password > 
( -u | --username ) <user name> 

-cf, or --column-family, followed by the name of the table to be backed up.
-t or --tag, followed by the snapshot name.
-- Separates an option and argument that could be mistaken for a option.
keyspace is one keyspace name that is required when using the -cf option, or one or more optional keyspace names, separated by a space.


Synopsis Legend 

 Angle brackets (< >) mean not literal, a variable
Italics mean optional
The pipe (|) symbol means OR or AND/OR
Ellipsis (...) means repeatable
Orange ( and ) means not literal, indicates scope 


Description 
Use this command to back up data using a snapshot. Depending on how you use the command, the following data is included:  All keyspaces on a node. 
Omit the optional keyspace and table parameters, as shown in the first example.

 One or more keyspaces and all tables in the named keyspaces. 
Include one or more names of the keyspaces, as shown in the second and third examples.

 A single table. 
Include the name of a single keyspace and a table using the -cf option, as shown in the last example.


Cassandra flushes the node before taking a snapshot, takes the snapshot, and stores the data in the snapshots directory of each keyspace in the data directory. If you do not specify the name of a snapshot directory using the -t option, Cassandra names the directory using the timestamp of the snapshot, for example 1391460334889. Follow the procedure for taking a snapshot before upgrading Cassandra. When upgrading, backup all keyspaces. For more information about snapshots, see Apache documentation . 


Example: All keyspaces 

Take a snapshot of all keyspaces on the node. On Linux, in the Cassandra bin directory, for example: 
$ ./nodetool snapshot

The following message appears:
Requested creating snapshot(s) for [all keyspaces] with snapshot name [1391464041163]
Snapshot directory: 1391464041163

Because you did not specify a snapshot name, Cassandra names snapshot directories using the timestamp of the snapshot. If the keyspace contains no data, empty directories are not created.


Example: Single keyspace snapshot 

Assuming you created the keyspace and tables in the music service example, take a snapshot of the music keyspace and name the snapshot 2014.06.24. On Linux, in the Cassandra bin directory, for example: 
$ ./nodetool snapshot -t 2014.06.24 music

The following message appears:
Requested creating snapshot(s) for [music] with snapshot name [2014.06.24]
Snapshot directory: 2014.06.24

Assuming the music keyspace contains two tables, songs and playlists, taking a snapshot of the keyspace creates multiple snapshot directories named 2014.06.24. A number of .db files containing the data are located in these directories. For example: $ cd /var/lib/cassandra/data/music/playlists-bf8118508cfd11e3972273ded3cb6170/snapshots/2014.06.24
$ ls
music-playlists-ka-1-CompressionInfo.db  music-playlists-ka-1-Index.db       music-playlists-ka-1-TOC.txt
music-playlists-ka-1-Data.db             music-playlists-ka-1-Statistics.db
music-playlists-ka-1-Filter.db           music-playlists-ka-1-Summary.db
$ cd /var/lib/cassandra/data/music/songs-b8e385a08cfd11e3972273ded3cb6170/2014.06.24/snapshots/2014.06.24
music-songs-ka-1-CompressionInfo.db	music-songs-ka-1-Index.db		music-songs-ka-1-TOC.txt
music-songs-ka-1-Data.db		music-songs-ka-1-Statistics.db
music-songs-ka-1-Filter.db		music-songs-ka-1-Summary.db


Example: Multiple keyspaces snapshot 

Assuming you created a keyspace named mykeyspace in addition to the music keyspace, take a snapshot of both keyspaces. On Linux, in the Cassandra bin directory, for example: 
$ ./nodetool snapshot mykeyspace music

The following message appears:
Requested creating snapshot(s) for [mykeyspace, music] with snapshot name [1391460334889]
Snapshot directory: 1391460334889


Example: Single table snapshot 

Take a snapshot of only the playlists table in the music keyspace. On Linux, in the Cassandra bin directory, for example: 
$ ./nodetool snapshot -cf playlists music
Requested creating snapshot(s) for [music] with snapshot name [1391461910600]
Snapshot directory: 1391461910600
Cassandra creates the snapshot directory named 1391461910600 that contains the backup data of playlists table in /var/lib/cassandra/data/music/playlists-bf8118508cfd11e3972273ded3cb6170/snapshots, for example.
