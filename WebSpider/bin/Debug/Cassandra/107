Installing the JNA from the JAR file
Installing JNA can improve Cassandra memory usage. 


Installing JNA can improve Cassandra memory usage. When installed and configured, Linux does not swap out the JVM, and thus avoids related performance issues. The latest version is recommended.


Procedure
Download the jna.jar or jna-platform.jar from https://github.com/twall/jna. 
Add the JAR file to install_location/lib (or place it in the CLASSPATH). 
Add the following lines in the /etc/security/limits.conf file for the user/group that runs Cassandra: 
$USER soft memlock unlimited
$USER hard memlock unlimited
