cfstats
Provides statistics about tables.


Provides statistics about tables.


Synopsis 
nodetool <options> cfstats -i -- (<keyspace>.<table> ... )
options are: ( -h | --host ) <host name> | <ip address> 
( -p | --port ) <port number>
( -pw | --password ) <password >
( -u | --username ) <user name>

-- Separates an option from an argument that could be mistaken for a option.
keyspace.table is one or more keyspace and table names in dot notation.


Synopsis Legend 

 Angle brackets (< >) mean not literal, a variable
Italics mean optional
The pipe (|) symbol means OR or AND/OR
Ellipsis (...) means repeatable
Orange ( and ) means not literal, indicates scope


Description 

The nodetool cfstats command provides statistics about one or more tables. You use dot notation to specify one or more keyspace and table names. If you do not specify a keyspace and table, Cassandra provides statistics about all tables.

This table describes the nodetool cfstats output.
