Logging in using cqlsh
How to create a cqlshrc file to avoid having enter credentials every time you launch cqlsh.


Typically, after configuring authentication, you log into cqlsh using the -u and -p options to the cqlsh command. To avoid having enter credentials every time you launch cqlsh, you can create a cqlshrc file in the .cassandra directory, which is in your home directory. When present, this file passes default login information to cqlsh. 


Procedure
Open a text editor and create a file that specifies a user name and password.
[authentication]
username = fred
password = !!bang!!$

Save the file in your home/.cassandra directory and name it cqlshrc. 
Set permissions on the file. 
To protect database login information, ensure that the file is secure from unauthorized access. 
Note: Sample cqlshrc files are available in: Packaged installations
