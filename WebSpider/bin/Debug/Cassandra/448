setcompactionthreshold
Sets minimum and maximum compaction thresholds for a table.


Sets minimum and maximum compaction thresholds for a table.


Synopsis 
nodetool <options> setcompactionthreshold -- <keyspace> <table> <minthreshold> <maxthreshold>
 options are: ( -h | --host ) <host name> | <ip address> 
( -p | --port ) <port number> 
( -pw | --password ) <password > 
( -u | --username ) <user name> 

-- Separates an option and argument that could be mistaken for a option.
keyspace is the name of a keyspace.
table is a table name.
minthreshold sets the minimum number of SSTables to trigger a minor compaction when using SizeTieredCompactionStrategy or DateTieredCompactionStrategy.
maxthreshold sets the maximum number of SSTables to allow in a minor compaction when using SizeTieredCompactionStrategy or DateTieredCompactionStrategy.


Synopsis Legend 

 Angle brackets (< >) mean not literal, a variable
Italics mean optional
The pipe (|) symbol means OR or AND/OR
Ellipsis (...) means repeatable
Orange ( and ) means not literal, indicates scope 


Description 
This parameter controls how many SSTables of a similar size must be present before a minor compaction is scheduled. The max_threshold sets an upper bound on the number of SSTables that may be compacted in a single minor compaction, as described in http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/MemtableSSTable . 
When using LeveledCompactionStrategy, maxthreshold sets the MAX_COMPACTING_L0, which limits the number of L0 SSTables that are compacted concurrently to avoid wasting memory or running out of memory when compacting highly overlapping SSTables.
