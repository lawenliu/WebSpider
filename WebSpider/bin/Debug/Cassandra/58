RandomPartitioner
The default partitioner prior to Cassandra 1.2.

The RandomPartitioner was the default partitioner prior to Cassandra 1.2. It is included for backwards compatibility. You can use it in later versions of Cassandra, even when using virtual nodes (vnodes). However, if you don't use vnodes, you must calculate the tokens, as described in Generating tokens.

The RandomPartition distributes data evenly across the nodes using an MD5 hash value of the row key. The possible range of hash values is from 0 to 2127 -1.

When using the RandomPartitioner, you can page through all rows using the token function in a CQL query.
