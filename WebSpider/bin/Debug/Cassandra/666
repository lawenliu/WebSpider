Recommended settings  

You can view the current limits using the ulimit -a command. Although limits can also be temporarily set using this command, DataStax recommends making the changes permanent:  

Packaged installs: Ensure that the following settings are included in the /etc/security/limits.d/cassandra.conf file: cassandra - memlock unlimited
cassandra - nofile 100000
cassandra - nproc 32768
cassandra - as unlimited

Tarball installs: Ensure that the following settings are included in the /etc/security/limits.conf file: * - memlock unlimited
* - nofile 100000
* - nproc 32768
* - as unlimited

If you run Cassandra as root, some Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, require setting the limits for root explicitly instead of using *: root - memlock unlimited
root - nofile 100000
root - nproc 32768
root - as unlimited

For CentOS, RHEL, OEL systems, also set the nproc limits in /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf : * - nproc 32768

For all installations, add the following line to /etc/sysctl.conf : vm.max_map_count = 131072

To make the changes take effect, reboot the server or run the following command: $ sudo sysctl -p

To confirm the limits are applied to the Cassandra process, run the following command where pid is the process ID of the currently running Cassandra process: $ cat /proc/<pid>/limits
