ring
Provides node status and information about the ring.


Provides node status and information about the ring.


Synopsis 
nodetool <options> ring ( -r |  --resolve-ip ) -- <keyspace>
 options are: ( -h | --host ) <host name> | <ip address> 
( -p | --port ) <port number> 
( -pw | --password ) <password > 
( -u | --username ) <user name> 

-r, or --resolve-ip, means to provide node names instead of IP addresses.
-- Separates an option and argument that could be mistaken for a option.
 keyspace is a keyspace name.

 Angle brackets (< >) mean not literal, a variable
Italics mean optional
The pipe (|) symbol means OR or AND/OR
Ellipsis (...) means repeatable
Orange ( and ) means not literal, indicates scope 


Description 

Displays node status and information about the ring as determined by the node being queried. This information can give you an idea of the load balance and if any nodes are down. If your cluster is not properly configured, different nodes may show a different ring. Check that the node appears the same way in the ring.If you use virtual nodes (vnodes), use nodetool status for succinct output. 
 Address 
The node's URL.

 DC (data center) 
The data center containing the node.

 Rack 
The rack or, in the case of Amazon EC2, the availability zone of the node.

 Status - Up or Down 
Indicates whether the node is functioning or not.

 State - N (normal), L (leaving), J (joining), M (moving) 
The state of the node in relation to the cluster.

 Load - updates every 90 seconds 
The amount of file system data under the cassandra data directory after excluding all content in the snapshots subdirectories. Because all SSTable data files are included, any data that is not cleaned up, such as TTL-expired cell or tombstoned data) is counted.

 Token 
The end of the token range up to and including the value listed. For an explanation of token ranges, see Data Distribution in the Ring . 

 Owns 
The percentage of the data owned by the node per data center times the replication factor. For example, a node can own 33% of the ring, but show100% if the replication factor is 3.

 Host ID 
The network ID of the node.
