Read requests
The three types of read requests that a coordinator node can send to a replica.

There are three types of read requests that a coordinator can send to a replica:
A direct read request
A digest request
A background read repair request

The coordinator node contacts one replica node with a direct read request. Then the coordinator sends a digest request to a number of replicas determined by the consistency level specified by the client. The digest request checks the data in the replica node to make sure it is up to date. Then the coordinator sends a digest request to all remaining replicas. If any replica nodes have out of date data, a background read repair request is sent. Read repair requests ensure that the requested row is made consistent on all replicas.

For a digest request the coordinator first contacts the replicas specified by the consistency level. The coordinator sends these requests to the replicas that are currently responding the fastest. The nodes contacted respond with a digest of the requested data; if multiple nodes are contacted, the rows from each replica are compared in memory to see if they are consistent. If they are not, then the replica that has the most recent data (based on the timestamp) is used by the coordinator to forward the result back to the client.

To ensure that all replicas have the most recent version of frequently-read data, the coordinator also contacts and compares the data from all the remaining replicas that own the row in the background. If the replicas are inconsistent, the coordinator issues writes to the out-of-date replicas to update the row to the most recent values. This process is known as read repair. Read repair can be configured per table for non-QUORUM consistency levels (using read_repair_chance), and is enabled by default.

For illustrated examples of read requests, see the examples of read consistency levels.


Rapid read protection using speculative_retry 

Rapid read protection allows Cassandra to still deliver read requests when the originally selected replica nodes are either down or taking too long to respond. If the table has been configured with the speculative_retry property, the coordinator node for the read request will retry the request with another replica node if the original replica node exceeds a configurable timeout value to complete the read request.
