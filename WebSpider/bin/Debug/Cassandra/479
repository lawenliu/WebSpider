Description 

This command starts the compaction process on tables that use the SizeTieredCompactionStrategy or DateTieredCompactionStrategy. You can specify a keyspace for compaction. If you do not specify a keyspace, the nodetool command uses the current keyspace. You can specify one or more tables for compaction. If you do not specify a table(s), compaction of all tables in the keyspace occurs. This is called a major compaction. If you do specify a table(s), compaction of the specified table(s) occurs. This is called a minor compaction. A major compaction consolidates all existing SSTables into a single SSTable. During compaction, there is a temporary spike in disk space usage and disk I/O because the old and new SSTables co-exist. A major compaction can cause considerable disk I/O.
