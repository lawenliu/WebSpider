Murmur3Partitioner
The Murmur3Partitioner provides faster hashing and improved performance than the previous default partitioner (RandomPartitioner).

The Murmur3Partitioner provides faster hashing and improved performance than the previous default partitioner (RandomPartitioner). You can only use Murmur3Partitioner for new clusters; you cannot change the partitioner in existing clusters. The Murmur3Partitioner uses the MurmurHash function. This hashing function creates a 64-bit hash value of the partition key. The possible range of hash values is from -263 to +263-1.

When using the Murmur3Partitioner, you can page through all rows using the token function in a CQL query.
