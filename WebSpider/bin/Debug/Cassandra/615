The sstableupgrade tool
Upgrade the SSTables in the specified table or snapshot to match the currently installed version of Cassandra.


This tool rewrites the SSTables in the specified table or snapshot to match the currently installed version of Cassandra.

If restoring with sstableloader, you must upgrade your snapshots before restoring for any snapshot taken in a major version older than the major version that Cassandra is currently running. 


Usage:
Packaged installs:  sstableupgrade [options] <keyspace> <cf> [snapshot]
Tarball installs:  install_location/bin/sstableupgrade [options] <keyspace> <cf> [snapshot]

The snapshot option only upgrades the specified snapshot.
