The native library snappy-1.0.4.1-libsnappyjava.so for Snappy compression is included in the snappy-java-1.0.4.1.jar file. When the JVM initializes the JAR, the library is added to the default temp directory. If the default temp directory is mounted with a noexec option, it results in the above exception.

One solution is to specify a different temp directory that has already been mounted without the noexec option, as follows:
If you use the DSE/Cassandra command $_BIN/dse cassandra or $_BIN/cassandra, simply append the command line:DSE: bin/dse cassandra -t -Dorg.xerial.snappy.tempdir=/path/to/newtmp
Cassandra: bin/cassandra -Dorg.xerial.snappy.tempdir=/path/to/newtmp

If starting from a package using service dse start or service cassandra start, add a system environment variable JVM_OPTS with the value:
JVM_OPTS=-Dorg.xerial.snappy.tempdir=/path/to/newtmp

The default cassandra-env.sh looks for the variable and appends to it when starting the JVM.
