Internal authentication
Internal authentication is based on Cassandra-controlled login accounts and passwords. 

Like object permission management using internal authorization, internal authentication is based on Cassandra-controlled login accounts and passwords. Internal authentication works for the following clients when you provide a user name and password to start up the client: 
Astyanax
cassandra-cli
cqlsh
DataStax drivers - produced and certified by DataStax to work with Cassandra.
Hector
pycassa

Internal authentication stores usernames and bcrypt-hashed passwords in the system_auth.credentials table.

PasswordAuthenticator is an IAuthenticator implementation that you can use to configure Cassandra for internal authentication out-of-the-box.
