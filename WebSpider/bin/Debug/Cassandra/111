Installing DataStax Community on any Linux-based platform
Install on all Linux-based platforms using a binary tarball. 


Use these steps to install Cassandra on all Linux-based platforms using a binary tarball.

Use this install for Mac OS X and platforms without package support, or if you do not have or want a root installation.


For a complete list of supported platforms, see DataStax Community â€“ Supported Platforms. 



Prerequisites
Latest version of Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition 8 (JDK) is recommended or OpenJDK 7. 
Note: The JDK is recommended for development and production systems. It provides tools that are not in the JRE, such as jstack, jmap, jps, and jstat, that are useful for troubleshooting.

Java Native Access (JNA) is required for production installations (latest version recommended). See Installing the JNA.
Python 2.6+ (needed if installing OpsCenter).
If you are using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, you must update to JNA 3.4, as described in Installing the JNA from the JAR file.
If you are using an older RHEL-based Linux distribution, such as CentOS-5, you may see the following error: GLIBCXX_3.4.9 not found. You must replace the Snappy compression/decompression library (snappy-java-1.0.5.jar) with the snappy-java-1.0.4.1.jar. 


The binary tarball runs as a stand-alone process.


Procedure

In a terminal window:
Check which version of Java is installed by running the following command: 
$ java -version


Note: It is recommended to use the latest version of Oracle Java 8 on all nodes. (Oracle Java 7 is also supported.)
See Installing Oracle JDK on RHEL-based Systems.
