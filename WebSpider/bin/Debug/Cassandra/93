Installing DataStax Community on Debian-based systems
Install using APT repositories on Debian and Ubuntu.


Use these steps to install Cassandra using APT repositories on Debian and Ubuntu Linux.


For a complete list of supported platforms, see DataStax Community â€“ Supported Platforms. 



Prerequisites
Advanced Package Tool is installed.
Root or sudo access to the install machine.
Python 2.6+ (needed if installing OpsCenter).
Latest version of Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition 8 (JDK) is recommended or OpenJDK 7. 
Note: The JDK is recommended for development and production systems. It provides tools that are not in the JRE, such as jstack, jmap, jps, and jstat, that are useful for troubleshooting.

Java Native Access (JNA) is required for production installations (latest version recommended). Installing the JNA on Debian or Ubuntu Systems.

Note: If you are using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, you must update to JNA 3.4, as described in Installing the JNA from the JAR file.


The packaged releases create a cassandra user. When starting Cassandra as a service, the service runs as this user. 


Procedure

In a terminal window:
Check which version of Java is installed by running the following command: 
$ java -version


Note: It is recommended to use the latest version of Oracle Java 8 on all nodes. (Oracle Java 7 is also supported.)
See Installing Oracle JDK on RHEL-based Systems.

Add the DataStax Community repository to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list 
$ echo "deb http://debian.datastax.com/community stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list

 Debian systems only:  In /etc/apt/sources.list, find the line that describes your source repository for Debian and add contrib non-free to the end of the line. For example:  
deb http://some.debian.mirror/debian/ $distro main contrib non-free

This allows installation of the Oracle JVM instead of the OpenJDK JVM.

Save and close the file when you are done adding/editing your sources. 

Add the DataStax repository key to your aptitude trusted keys.  
$ curl -L http://debian.datastax.com/debian/repo_key | sudo apt-key add -

Install the package. For example: 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install dsc20=2.0.11-1 cassandra=2.0.11

Check Download DataStax Community Edition on Planet Cassandra for the latest version. 

This installs the DataStax Community distribution of Cassandra. .

Because the Debian packages start the Cassandra service automatically, you must stop the server and clear the data: 

Doing this removes the default cluster_name (Test Cluster) from the system table. All nodes must use the same cluster name.

$ sudo service cassandra stop
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/data/system/*

The DataStax Community distribution of Cassandra is ready for configuration.
