The sstablesplit utility
Use this tool to split SSTables files into multiple SSTables of a maximum designated size.


Use this tool to split SSTables files into multiple SSTables of a maximum designated size. For example, if SizeTieredCompactionStrategy was used for a major compaction and results in a excessively large SSTable, it's a good idea to split the table because won't get compacted again until the next huge compaction.
