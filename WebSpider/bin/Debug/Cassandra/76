Ec2MultiRegionSnitch
Use this snitch for deployments on Amazon EC2 where the cluster spans multiple regions.

Configuring cassandra.yaml for cross-region communication

The Ec2MultiRegionSnitch uses public IP designated in the broadcast_address to allow cross-region connectivity. Configure each node as follows:
In the cassandra.yaml, set the listen_address to the private IP address of the node, and the broadcast_address to the public IP address of the node. 
This allows Cassandra nodes in one EC2 region to bind to nodes in another region, thus enabling multiple data center support. For intra-region traffic, Cassandra switches to the private IP after establishing a connection.

The location of cassandra.yaml file depends on the type of installation: Packaged installs: /etc/cassandra/cassandra-rackdc.properties
Tarball installs: install_location/conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties

Set the addresses of the seed nodes in the cassandra.yaml file to that of the public IP. Private IP are not routable between networks. For example:seeds: 50.34.16.33, 60.247.70.52

To find the public IP address, from each of the seed nodes in EC2:
$ curl http://instance-data/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4

Note: Do not make all nodes seeds, see Internode communications (gossip).

Be sure that the storage_port or ssl_storage_port is open on the public IP firewall.


Configuring the snitch for cross-region communication

In EC2 deployments, the The region name is treated as the data center name and availability zones are treated as racks within a data center. For example, if a node is in the us-east-1 region, us-east is the data center name and 1 is the rack location. (Racks are important for distributing replicas, but not for data center naming.) 

For each node, specify its data center in the cassandra-rackdc.properties. The dc_suffix option defines the data centers used by the snitch. Any other lines are ignored.  

In the example below, there are two cassandra data centers and each data center is named for its workload. The data center naming convention in this example is based on the workload. You can use other conventions, such as DC1, DC2 or 100, 200. (Data center names are case-sensitive.) 



Region: us-east

Region: us-west


Node and data center:node0 
dc_suffix=_1_cassandra

node1
dc_suffix=_1_cassandra

node2
dc_suffix=_2_cassandra

node3 
dc_suffix=_2_cassandra

node4 
dc_suffix=_1_analytics

node5 
dc_suffix=_1_search


This results in four us-east data centers:us-east_1_cassandra
us-east_2_cassandra
us-east_1_analytics
us-east_1_search
Node and data center:node0
dc_suffix=_1_cassandra

node1
dc_suffix=_1_cassandra

node2
dc_suffix=_2_cassandra

node3 
dc_suffix=_2_cassandra

node4
dc_suffix=_1_analytics

node5 
dc_suffix=_1_search


This results in four us-west data centers:us-west_1_cassandra
us-west_2_cassandra
us-west_1_analytics
us-west_1_search



Keyspace strategy options 

When defining your keyspace strategy options, use the EC2 region name, such as ``us-east``, as your data center name.
