Description 

Run the nodetool tpstats command on the local node. The nodetool tpstats command provides statistics about the number of active, pending, and completed tasks for each stage of Cassandra operations by thread pool. A high number of pending tasks for any pool can indicate performance problems, as described in http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations#Monitoring . 

This table describes the indicators:
