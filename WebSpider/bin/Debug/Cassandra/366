Replacing a dead seed node
Steps to replace a seed node.


Steps to replace a seed node.

Because Cassandra doesn't allow a seed node to be bootstrapped, use the following steps for replacing the dead node:


Procedure
Promote an existing node to a seed node by adding its IP address to -seeds list and remove (demote) the IP address of the dead seed node from the cassandra.yaml file for each node in the cluster. 
Replace the dead node, as described in Replacing a dead node.
