Configuring firewall port access
Which ports to open when nodes are protected by a firewall.


If you have a firewall running on the nodes in your Cassandra cluster, you must open up the following ports to allow communication between the nodes, including certain Cassandra ports. If this isnâ€™t done, when you start Cassandra on a node, the node acts as a standalone database server rather than joining the database cluster.
