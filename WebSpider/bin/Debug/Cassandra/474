The nodetool utility
A command line interface for Cassandra for managing a cluster.


Command format 

The nodetool utility is a command line interface for managing a cluster.
Packaged installs: nodetool -h HOSTNAME [-p JMX_PORT ] COMMAND
Tarball installs: install_location/bin/nodetool -h HOSTNAME [-p JMX_PORT ] COMMAND
Remote Method Invocation: nodetool -h HOSTNAME [-p JMX_PORT -u JMX_USERNAME -pw JMX_PASSWORD ] COMMAND
If a username and password for RMI authentication are set explicitly in the cassandra-env.sh file for the host, then you must specify credentials.


Most nodetool commands operate on a single node in the cluster if -h is not used to identify one or more other nodes. These commands operate cluster-wide: rebuild
repair
taketoken

If the node from which you issue the command is the intended target, you do not need the -h option to identify the target; otherwise, identify the target node, or nodes, using the -h option.

move

Moves the node on the token ring to a new token.


netstats

Provides network information about the host.


pausehandoff

Pauses the hints delivery process.


proxyhistograms

Provides a histogram of network statistics.


rangekeysample

Provides the sampled keys held across all keyspaces.


rebuild

Rebuilds data by streaming from other nodes.


rebuild_index

Performs a full rebuild of the index for a table.


refresh

Loads newly placed SSTables onto the system without a restart.


removenode

Provides the status of current node removal, forces completion of pending removal, or removes the identified node.


repair

Repairs one or more tables.


resetlocalschema

Reset the node's local schema and resynchronizes.


resumehandoff

Resume hints delivery process.


ring

Provides node status and information about the ring.


scrub

Rebuild SSTables for one or more Cassandra tables.


setcachecapacity

Set global key and row cache capacities in megabytes.


setcachekeystosave

Sets the number of keys saved by each cache for faster post-restart warmup.


setcompactionthreshold

Sets minimum and maximum compaction thresholds for a table.


setcompactionthroughput

statusbinary

Provide the status of native transport.


statusthrift

Provide the status of the Thrift server.


stop

Stops the compaction process.


stopdaemon

Stops the cassandra daemon.


taketoken

Deprecated. Do not use. Using this command can result in data loss.


tpstats

Provides usage statistics of thread pools.


truncatehints

Truncates all hints on the local node, or truncates hints for the one or more endpoints. 


upgradesstables

Rewrites SSTables for tables that are not running the current version of Cassandra.


version

Provides the version number of Cassandra running on the specified node.
