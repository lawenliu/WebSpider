What's new in Cassandra
An overview of new features in Cassandra.

Cassandra 2.0 included major enhancements to CQL, security, and performance. CQL for Cassandra 2.0.6 adds several important features including batching of conditional updates, static columns, and increased control over slicing of clustering columns. 

Key features of Cassandra 2.0 are:
Support for lightweight transactions Use of the IF keyword in CQL INSERT and UPDATE statements
New SERIAL consistency level

Triggers
The first phase of support for triggers for firing an event that executes a set of programmatic logic, which runs either inside or outside a database cluster

CQL paging support 
Paging of result sets of SELECT statements executed over a CQL native protocol 2 connection, which eliminates the need to use the token function to page through results. For example, to page through data in this table, a simple SELECT statement after Cassandra 2.0 replaces the complex one using the token function before Cassandra 2.0.





Improved authentication
SASL support for easier and better authentication over prior versions of the CQL native protocol

Drop column support
Re-introduction of the ALTER TABLE DROP command

SELECT column aliases
Support for column aliases in a SELECT statement, similar to aliases in RDBMS SQL:SELECT hdate AS hired_date 
  FROM emp WHERE empid = 500

Conditional DDL
Conditionally tests for the existence of a table, keyspace, or index before issuing a DROP or CREATE statement using IF EXISTS or IF NOT EXISTS

 Index enhancements
Indexing of any part, partition key or clustering columns, portion of a compound primary key

One-off prepare and execute statements 
Use of a prepared statement, even for the single execution of a query to pass binary values for a statement, for example to avoid a conversion of a blob to a string, over a native protocol version 2 connection

Performance enhancementsOff-heap partition summary
Eager retries support
Sending the user request to other replicas before the query times out when a replica is unusually slow in delivering needed data 

Compaction improvements
Hybrid (leveled and size-tiered) compaction improvements to the leveled compaction strategy to reduce the performance overhead on read operations when compaction cannot keep pace with write-heavy workloads



Other changes in Cassandra 2.0 are:New commands to disable background compactions
nodetool disableautocompaction and nodetool enableautocompaction 

A change to random token selection during cluster setup
Auto_bootstrapping of a single-token node with no initial_token

Removal of super column support
Continued support for apps that query super columns, translation of super columns on the fly into CQL constructs and results

Removal of the cqlsh ASSUME command
Use the blobAsType and typeAsBlob conversion functions instead of ASSUME


Cqlsh COPY command support for collections

Inclusion of the native protocol version in the system.local table 
Inclusion of default_time_to_live, speculative_retry, and memtable_flush_period_in_ms in cqlsh DESCRIBE TABLE output
Support for an empty list of values in the IN clause of SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands, useful in Java Driver applications when passing empty arrays as arguments for the IN clause
