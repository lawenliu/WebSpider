Configuring the heap dump directory
Analyzing the heap dump file can help troubleshoot memory problems. 


Analyzing the heap dump file can help troubleshoot memory problems. Cassandra starts Java with the option -XX:-HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError. Using this option triggers a heap dump in the event of an out-of-memory condition. The heap dump file consists of references to objects that cause the heap to overflow. By default, Cassandra puts the file a subdirectory of the working, root directory when running as a service. If Cassandra does not have write permission to the root directory, the heap dump fails. If the root directory is too small to accommodate the heap dump, the server crashes.

For a heap dump to succeed and to prevent crashes, configure a heap dump directory that meets these requirements:
Accessible to Cassandra for writing
Large enough to accommodate a heap dump

This file is located in:Packaged installs: /etc/dse/cassandra
Tarball installs: install_location/resources/cassandra/conf

Base the size of the directory on the value of the Java -mx option.


Procedure

Open the cassandra-env.sh file for editing.  
# set jvm HeapDumpPath with CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR

Scroll down to the comment about the heap dump path: 
# set jvm HeapDumpPath with CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR

On the line after the comment, set the CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR to the path you want to use: 
# set jvm HeapDumpPath with CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR 
CASSANDRA_HEAPDUMP_DIR =<path>

Save the cassandra-env.sh file and restart.
