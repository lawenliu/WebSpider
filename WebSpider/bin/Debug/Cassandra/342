Monitoring and adjusting caching
Use nodetool to make changes to cache options and then monitor the effects of each change.

Make changes to cache options in small, incremental adjustments, then monitor the effects of each change using DataStax OpsCenter or the nodetool utility. The output of the nodetool info command shows the following row cache and key cache metrics, which are configured in the cassandra.yaml file:Cache size in bytes
Capacity in bytes
Number of hits
Number of requests
Recent hit rate
Duration in seconds after which Cassandra saves the key cache.

For example, on start-up, the information from nodetool info might look something like this:
Token            : (invoke with -T/--tokens to see all 256 tokens)
ID               : 387d15ba-7103-491b-9327-1a691dbb504a
Gossip active    : true
Thrift active    : true
Native Transport active: true
Load             : 11.35 KB
Generation No    : 1384180190
Uptime (seconds) : 437
Heap Memory (MB) : 136.33 / 1996.81
Data Center      : datacenter1
Rack             : rack1
Exceptions       : 0
Key Cache        : size 360 (bytes), capacity 103809024 (bytes), 15 hits, 19 requests, 0.789 recent hit rate, 14400 save period in seconds
Row Cache        : size 0 (bytes), capacity 0 (bytes), 0 hits, 0 requests, NaN recent hit rate, 0 save period in seconds

In the event of high memory consumption, consider tuning data caches.
