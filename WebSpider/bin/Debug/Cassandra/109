Installing DataStax Community on RHEL-based systems
Install using Yum repositories on RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux.


Use these steps to install Cassandra using Yum repositories on RHEL, CentOS, and Oracle Linux.


Note: To install on SUSE, use the Cassandra binary tarball distribution.

For a complete list of supported platforms, see DataStax Community â€“ Supported Platforms. 



Prerequisites
Yum Package Management application installed.
Root or sudo access to the install machine.
Latest version of Oracle Java Platform, Standard Edition 8 (JDK) is recommended or OpenJDK 7. 
Note: The JDK is recommended for development and production systems. It provides tools that are not in the JRE, such as jstack, jmap, jps, and jstat, that are useful for troubleshooting.

Python 2.6+ (needed if installing OpsCenter).
Java Native Access (JNA) is required for production installations (latest version recommended). See Installing the JNA on RHEL or CentOS Systems.


The packaged releases create a cassandra user. When starting Cassandra as a service, the service runs as this user. 


Procedure

In a terminal window:
Check which version of Java is installed by running the following command: 
$ java -version


Note: It is recommended to use the latest version of Oracle Java 8 on all nodes. (Oracle Java 7 is also supported.)
See Installing Oracle JDK on RHEL-based Systems.

Add the DataStax Community repository to the /etc/yum.repos.d/datastax.repo:  
[datastax] 
name = DataStax Repo for Apache Cassandra
baseurl = http://rpm.datastax.com/community
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0

Install the packages: 
$ sudo yum install dsc20-2.0.x-1 cassandra2.0.x-1

For example, to install DataStax Community 2.0.11:$ sudo yum install dsc20-2.0.11-1 cassandra20-2.0.11-1

Check Download DataStax Community Edition on Planet Cassandra for the latest version. 

The DataStax Community distribution of Cassandra is ready for configuration.
