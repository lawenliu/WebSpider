Data distribution and replication
How data is distributed and factors influencing replication.

In Cassandra, data distribution and replication go together. Data is organized by table and identified by a primary key, which determines which node the data is stored on. Replicas are copies of rows. When data is first written, it is also referred to as a replica.

Factors influencing replication include:
Virtual nodes: assigns data ownership to physical machines.
Partitioner: partitions the data across the cluster.
Replication strategy: determines the replicas for each row of data.
Snitch: defines the topology information that the replication strategy uses to place replicas.

Consistent hashing

Consistent hashing allows distributing data across a cluster which minimizes reorganization when nodes are added or removed.


Virtual nodes

Overview of virtual nodes (vnodes).


Data replication

Cassandra stores replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance. A replication strategy determines the nodes where replicas are placed.
