Dynamic snitching
Monitors the performance of reads from the various replicas and chooses the best replica based on this history.

By default, all snitches also use a dynamic snitch layer that monitors read latency and, when possible, routes requests away from poorly-performing nodes. The dynamic snitch is enabled by default and is recommended for use in most deployments. For information on how this works, see Dynamic snitching in Cassandra: past, present, and future. Configure dynamic snitch thresholds for each node in the cassandra.yaml configuration file.

For more information, see the properties listed under Failure detection and recovery.
