Understanding the architecture
Important topics for understanding Cassandra.
Topics in this section: 

Architecture in brief

Essential information for understanding and using Cassandra.


Internode communications (gossip)

Cassandra uses a protocol called gossip to discover location and state information about the other nodes participating in a Cassandra cluster.


Data distribution and replication

How data is distributed and factors influencing replication.


Partitioners

A partitioner determines how data is distributed across the nodes in the cluster (including replicas).


Snitches

A snitch determines which data centers and racks nodes belong to.


Client requests

Client read or write requests can be sent to any node in the cluster because all nodes in Cassandra are peers.


Planning a cluster deployment

Vital information about successfully deploying a Cassandra cluster.
