Installing the JNA on RHEL or CentOS Systems
Installing JNA can improve Cassandra memory usage. 


Installing JNA can improve Cassandra memory usage. When installed and configured, Linux does not swap out the JVM, and thus avoids related performance issues. The latest version is recommended.



Prerequisites
Cassandra requires JNA 3.2.7 or later. Some Yum repositories may provide earlier versions.
EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). See Installing EPEL.


Procedure
Install with the following command: 
$ sudo yum install jna

If you can't install using Yum or it provides a version of the JNA earlier than 3.2.7, install as described in Installing the JNA from the JAR file.
