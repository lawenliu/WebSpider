Cassandra storage basics
Understanding how Casssandra stores data.

To manage and access data in Cassandra, it is important to understand how Casssandra stores data. The hinted handoff feature and Cassandra conformance and non-conformance to the ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable) database properties are key concepts in this discussion. In Cassandra, consistency refers to how up-to-date and synchronized a row of data is on all of its replicas. 

Client utilities and application programming interfaces (APIs) for developing applications for data storage and retrieval are available.
