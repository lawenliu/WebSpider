Separate table directories
Cassandra provides fine-grained control of table storage on disk.

Cassandra provides fine-grained control of table storage on disk, writing tables to disk using separate table directories within each keyspace directory. Data files are stored using this directory and file naming format:

/var/lib/cassandra/data/ks1/cf1/ks1-cf1-hc-1-Data.db

The new file name format includes the keyspace name to distinguish which keyspace and table the file contains when streaming or bulk loading data. Cassandra creates a subdirectory for each table, which allows you to symlink a table to a chosen physical drive or data volume. This provides the capability to move very active tables to faster media, such as SSDâ€™s for better performance, and also divvy up tables across all attached storage devices for better I/O balance at the storage layer.
